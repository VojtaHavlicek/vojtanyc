<h2 id="let-me-explain-you-the-rules-first">Let me explain you the rules first</h2>
<p>Let me explain you the rules first. I fed the following prompt to ChatGPT o1:</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Let me explain you the rules first:</p>
<p>The game is a turn-based strategy where two players play against each other. Each player tries to connect energy resources (green circles with R) to habitats (circles labeled with P) using pipes (the thick lines).</p>
<p>Each habitat has a certain population (the number that appears after P). The goal of the game is to get a total population of 30 before your oponent and not run out of energy.</p>
<p>You can do it as follows: each player starts with 10 energy. In every turn, you can either build two pipes (each cost 1 energy) or transform a pipe into a habitat (for 5 energy). You cannot branch pipes, but you can build in all four directions around a habitat.</p>
<p>Each habitat starts with 2 population and has at most 10 inhabitants. It produces 3 energy in every round, but every inhabitant also consumes 1 energy. Every three rounds, the population of a habitat increases by one, unless it is at maximum capacity.</p>
<p>You can use pipes to connect Resources. Each resource adds 2 energy per round.</p>
<p>Lastly, the game happens on a 15 x 15 board that &ldquo;wraps around&rdquo;. So you can build pipes from right edge to the left edge and from the bottom edge to the top edge. Pipes cannot cross.</p>
<p>Can you rewrite the above  so that the rules are easy to understand and I can check that you understood?</p></blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the concise answer. Not bad!</p>
<blockquote>
<h1 id="game-rules-turn-based-strategy">Game Rules: Turn-Based Strategy</h1>

<h2 id="3-energy-and-habitats">3. Energy and Habitats</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Starting Energy:</strong> Each player begins with <strong>10</strong> energy.</li>
<li><strong>Habitats (P):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Start with <strong>2</strong> inhabitants each.</li>
<li>Maximum population is <strong>10</strong>.</li>
<li>Produce <strong>3</strong> energy per round.</li>
<li>Each inhabitant consumes <strong>1</strong> energy per round.</li>
<li><strong>Population Growth:</strong> Every 3 rounds, each habitat’s population increases by <strong>1</strong>, unless the habitat is already at its max (10).</li>

<hr>
<h2 id="4-resources-r">4. Resources (R)</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Resources (R):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Each resource connected to a habitat via a chain of pipes adds <strong>+2</strong> energy per round.</li>
<li>A connection is considered valid if there is a continuous path of pipes from the resource to the habitat.</li>

<li>Used to connect resources (R) to habitats (P).</li>
<li><strong>Pipes cannot cross</strong> one another.</li>
<li><strong>No Branching:</strong> You cannot branch a pipe from the middle of another pipe.</li>
<li><strong>Where to Build Pipes:</strong> Besides building directly from a habitat, you can <strong>only</strong> extend new pipes from the <strong>current pipe ends</strong> (the open endpoints, not from the middle).</li>
<li>You can build in the four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Turns:</strong> On your turn, you must choose <strong>one</strong> of the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Build two pipes</strong> (cost = 1 energy each).</li>
<li><strong>Transform one pipe into a new habitat</strong> (cost = 5 energy).</li>

<ul>
<li>1 energy for each inhabitant in your habitats.</li>

<h2 id="7-victory">7. Victory</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Population Goal:</strong> Reach a total of <strong>30</strong> inhabitants (across all your habitats) before your opponent.</li>

</ul>

<p>Feeding rules of the game to ChatGPT o1 came up in a discussion with Tom Krcha and he ran the first couple of experiments with similarly good results.</p>
<h2 id="many-ways-to-skin-the-game">Many ways to skin the game</h2>
<p><code>Constraints? What constraints - Tom Krcha</code></p>
<p>Now that the model has some rules context about the basic game concepts, let&rsquo;s see how lucky we get with skinning. Here&rsquo;s my first prompt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img src="/images/cropped_test.png" alt="cropped">
Great! Here is a snapshot of the current game interface. Could you add textures to it?</p>
<p>I would like the environment to look like a deserted planet, perhaps mars in the distant future, inhabited by the first few humans.</p></blockquote>
<p>ChatGPT gave me a guideline on how to design the tileset, but did not give me any graphics first. It then helped me to generate a project structure to display the tiles correctly. But then came a shocker, it output a PNG in Base64 encoding as a desert tile!</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this does not seem to be valid (if you somehow manage to decode this, let me know). I tried for some time, but ultimately failed. Also, what a way to potentially get some malware into your laptop! On the next attempt, ChatGPT got frustrated and it spit out a Python script to generate a texture!</p>

</code></pre><p>Here&rsquo;s the masterpiece: <img src="/images/masterpiece.png" alt="Generated image">
So why not try to generate the whole set of tiles, this time in 128x128?</p>
<p>This was the answer:</p>
<p><img src="/images/mars_tile_0.png" alt="Tileset">,<img src="/images/mars_tile_1.png" alt="Tileset"></p>
<p>Kind of boring. Can you add some debris, rocks and craters to add variety? This gave me the following image generator:</p>
<p><img src="/images/mars_tiles_craters/mars_tile_0.png" alt="Tileset">,<img src="/images/mars_tiles_craters/mars_tile_1.png" alt="Tileset">, <img src="/images/mars_tiles_craters/mars_tile_2.png" alt="Tileset">, <img src="/images/mars_tiles_craters/mars_tile_3.png" alt="Tileset"></p>
<p>Not entirely useful, but there seems to be some potential. So let&rsquo;s force it to use Perlin noise?</p>
<p><img src="/images/mars_tiles_perlin/mars_perlin_0.png" alt="Tileset">,<img src="/images/mars_tiles_perlin/mars_perlin_1.png" alt="Tileset">, <img src="/images/mars_tiles_perlin/mars_perlin_2.png" alt="Tileset">, <img src="/images/mars_tiles_perlin/mars_perlin_3.png" alt="Tileset"></p>
<p>Add &ldquo;shader&rdquo; behavior, so that the splats blend in better with the background? That did not work well at all:</p>
<p><img src="/images/mars_tiles_blurred/mars_blurred_0.png" alt="Tileset">,<img src="/images/mars_tiles_blurred/mars_blurred_1.png" alt="Tileset">, <img src="/images/mars_tiles_blurred/mars_blurred_2.png" alt="Tileset">, <img src="/images/mars_tiles_blurred/mars_blurred_3.png" alt="Tileset"></p>
<p>oh well&hellip;</p>
<h3 id="pipes">Pipes</h3>
<p>The first results look like this:</p>
<p><img src="/images/pipe_textures_perfect_arcs/pipe_corner_EN.png" alt="Tileset">, <img src="/images/pipe_textures_perfect_arcs/pipe_corner_ES.png" alt="Tileset">, <img src="/images/pipe_textures_perfect_arcs/pipe_horizontal.png" alt="Tileset"></p>
<p>At this point, things fellt like a huge letdown, until I got this message from Tom:
<img src="/images/tom_colony/a1.png" alt="Preview"></p>
<h2 id="round-2">Round 2</h2>
<p>After all that we&rsquo;ve been through, let me just ask&hellip;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can you generate an image asset for the habitat?</p></blockquote>
<p><img src="/images/Habitat.webp" alt="Habitat"></p>
<p>Not bad at all after all that pain. What about a list of sprites:</p>
<p><img src="/images/spritesheet_habitat.webp" alt="Habitat"></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it, the middle four look almost immediately useful! It&rsquo;s getting really late though. I will carry on with this later.</p>
