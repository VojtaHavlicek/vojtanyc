We are currently developing a turn based strategy game with Michal Srb. The multiplayer is done, what remains is the AI. This series of blogposts will follow my journey towards implementing a (hopefully) decent oponnent.
From what I know now, it seems to be the best to:

Implement a basic minimax strategy on a simpler game.
Implement interesting heuristics on that simpler game.
Use Monte-Carlo tree search on that simpler game.
Port one of those strategies to our game.
Keep an eye our on the LLMs in the process. I will implement both a strategist that uses LLM queries and use LLMs to help me with the code.

The simplest game I could think of is Tic Tac Toe and it&rsquo;s bigger brother called Piskvorky (Czech only) or Gomoku. A simple warmup is a Tic Tac Toe on 3x3 board.">
